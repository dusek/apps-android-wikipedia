This is a fork of an upstream repository, only for the purposes of creating bug fix branches and associated pull requests. `master` branch has no meaning here (it has only on the upstream repository), so there is no `master`.

As no feature branch can be a default branch shown by GitHub, instead, this dummy branch `_default` is shown by default and contains only this `README.md` file. If you are interested in the bug fixes implemented in this repository, check out its branches. If you are interested in the upstream project, please go to is GitHub page.
